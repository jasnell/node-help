# Node.js Help

Hello there. Every other week, starting in August 2019, I will be setting aside one hour dedicated to helping individuals either (a) make their first commit and PR to Node.js or (b) help them work through some Node.js issue they may be having. If you're interested, open an issue here with the information detailed below. Depending on how many requests I get, I might not be able to get to every one of them, but I will do my best. All I ask in return is that you be patient with regards to getting scheduled and somewhat flexible in the times.

# What I need from you

If you're interested in opening your first PR to Node.js or have an issue you'd like me to try helping you with, open an issue in this repo with the following bits of information. ***I will respond to the issues in the order they are created.***

1. Your github handle and a name (any name that you wish for me to refer to you by)
1. Your personal pronouns (e.g. mine are he/him)
1. Your timezone offset (mine is UTC-8)
1. Your native language if not English (the only language I speak fluently besides English is nonsense, so at least some English will be necessary)
1. Pick one: Help opening a Node.js PR or Help with a Node.js Issue
1. What operating system are you using (distribution, major version, and build version)
1. Whether or not you've ever contributed to an open source project
1. The name of (a) a pet, (b) your favorite character in literature, or (c) a favorite poem (yes, I'm serious :-) ... for instance, I have three dogs named Shira, Boo, and Shortie)
1. Permission to mention any of the above here in the repo and on Twitter.
1. Your agreement to abide by the Code of Conduct while commenting within this repo and on the phone chat.

# The Process

I will respond to each issue opened in the order they are opened. It might take me some time to respond, please don't get frustrated or ping me multiple times. Depending on how popular this ends up being, it might take some time to get to you. Keep in mind that there are only 26 "every-other-weeks" per year, so there's a limit on how many of these I can do.

For each of the issues, when I'm able to get around to the scheduling, I will respond confirming and offering a few dates/times within the target week. Please keep in mind that dates may have to shift depending on what is happening the specific week. I ask only that you have some flexibility to work with me on the scheduling.

I will ask you to send me your email address so that I can send a proper calendar invitation that will have the call-in details.

Prior to the actual call, I will send out instructions and guides for any steps that may be necessary in advance (e.g. there's a dev environment set up that you'll need to open your first Node.js PR).

***Keep in mind that I reserve the right to cancel the call at any time and for any reason. Typically I would only do this if someone is being rude, demanding, or is not acting in good faith.***

***I also reserve the right to change this process or stop at any time for any reason... I mean, that really should be obvious ;-) ...***
